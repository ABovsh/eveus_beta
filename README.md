## Prerequisites

### Required Helper Entities
Before installing the integration, you must create these helper entities in Home Assistant:

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand helper entity setup instructions</b></summary>

1. Go to Settings â†’ Devices & Services â†’ Helpers
2. Click the "+ CREATE HELPER" button
3. Choose "Number"
4. Create each of these helpers with the exact input_number names:

```yaml
input_number:
  ev_battery_capacity:
    name: "EV Battery Capacity"
    min: 10
    max: 160
    step: 1
    unit_of_measurement: "kWh"
    mode: slider      # Optional but recommended
    icon: mdi:car-battery
    # Initial value should match your EV's battery capacity

  ev_initial_soc:
    name: "Initial EV State of Charge"
    min: 0
    max: 100
    step: 1
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    mode: slider      # Optional but recommended
    icon: mdi:battery-charging-40
    # Set this before each charging session

  ev_soc_correction:
    name: "Charging Efficiency Loss"
    min: 0
    max: 10
    step: 0.1
    initial: 7.5     # Default efficiency loss
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    mode: slider      # Optional but recommended
    icon: mdi:chart-bell-curve
    # Adjust based on your observed charging efficiency

  ev_target_soc:
    name: "Target SOC"
    min: 80
    max: 100
    step: 10
    initial: 80      # Default target
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    mode: slider      # Optional but recommended
    icon: mdi:battery-charging-high
    # Adjust based on your charging needs
```

Alternatively, you can add these helpers via YAML by adding the above configuration to your `configuration.yaml`.
</details>

> **Important**: The integration will verify these helpers exist during setup and display an error if any are missing or incorrectly configured.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Connection Problems**
   - Verify your EV charger is on the same network as Home Assistant
   - Check that you can reach the charger's IP address from the Home Assistant host
   - Ensure the username and password are correct

2. **SOC Calculation Issues**
   - Make sure all required helper entities are created with the exact names shown
   - Verify your EV's battery capacity is correctly set
   - Reset initial SOC before each new charging session

3. **Reset Procedure**
   If the integration behaves unexpectedly:
   - Restart the Home Assistant service
   - If issues persist, remove and re-add the integration
   - Check the Home Assistant logs for any errors related to the Eveus integration

### Logs and Debugging

For detailed logging, add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.eveus: debug
```
