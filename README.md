### Required Helper Entities
Before installing the integration, you must create these helper entities in Home Assistant:

1. Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers
2. Click the "+ CREATE HELPER" button
3. Choose "Number"
4. Create each of these helpers with the exact input_number names:

```yaml
input_number:
  ev_battery_capacity:
    name: "EV Battery Capacity"
    min: 10
    max: 160
    step: 1
    unit_of_measurement: "kWh"
    mode: slider      # Optional but recommended
    icon: mdi:car-battery
    # This is the total usable capacity of your EV's battery (e.g., 80 kWh for Tesla Model 3 LR)
    # Used to calculate accurate SOC percentages and remaining charging time
    # Should match the value in your EV's manual or settings

  ev_initial_soc:
    name: "Initial EV State of Charge"
    min: 0
    max: 100
    step: 1
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    mode: slider      # Optional but recommended
    icon: mdi:battery-charging-40
    # This should be set to your EV's current SOC displayed on the dashboard before starting to charge
    # Must be updated at the beginning of each charging session for accurate calculations
    # This acts as your starting point for SOC tracking

  ev_soc_correction:
    name: "Charging Efficiency Loss"
    min: 0
    max: 10
    step: 0.1
    initial: 7.5     # Default efficiency loss
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    mode: slider      # Optional but recommended
    icon: mdi:chart-bell-curve
    # Accounts for energy lost during charging due to heat, cable resistance, etc.
    # Typical values are 5-10% (7.5% is a good starting point)
    # Adjust this value based on comparing the integration's SOC with your EV's actual SOC

  ev_target_soc:
    name: "Target SOC"
    min: 80
    max: 100
    step: 10
    initial: 80      # Default target
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    mode: slider      # Optional but recommended
    icon: mdi:battery-charging-high
    # Set the desired SOC you want to reach for this charging session
    # Used to calculate "Time to Target SOC" and can be used for automation triggers
    # Many users set this to 80-90% for daily charging to preserve battery health
```

> **Important**: The integration will verify these helpers exist during setup and display an error if any are missing or incorrectly configured.

> **Note**: You may need to adjust the charging current slider's min and max values based on your charger model (8-16A for 16A models or 8-32A for 32A models).

> **Tip**: For the best experience, place this control panel on your mobile dashboard for easy access when near your vehicle.

## Notifications

You can set up automations to receive notifications about your EV charging status. These will alert you when charging starts, completes, or when the current changes.

![Notifications Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2bf4866-bf4e-4bc0-8415-e3c6d6d7b0e9)

### Setting Up Notifications

1. Go to Settings > Automations & Scenes
2. Click "+ Create Automation"
3. Choose "Create new automation" and select "Start with an empty automation"
4. Set up the following automations:

#### 1. Session Start Notification

This automation notifies you when your EV begins charging:

1. Download the YAML from [301_EV_Charging_Started.yaml](https://github.com/ABovsh/eveus/blob/main/Notifications/301_EV_Charging_Started%20(1).yaml)
2. Open the file in a text editor and copy all the content
3. In Home Assistant, after creating an empty automation:
   - Click the three dots in the top right corner
   - Select "Edit in YAML"
   - Delete any default content
   - Paste the YAML content from the downloaded file
   - Replace `notify.notify` or similar with your notification service (e.g., `notify.mobile_app_your_phone`)
   - Click "Save"

#### 2. Current Change Notification

This automation notifies you when the charging current changes:

1. Download the YAML from [302_EV_Charging_CurrentChanged.yaml](https://github.com/ABovsh/eveus/blob/main/Notifications/302_EV_Charging_CurrentChanged%20(1).yaml)
2. Create a new empty automation as described above
3. Edit in YAML mode and paste the content from the downloaded file
4. Replace the notification service with your preferred notification method
5. Click "Save"

#### 3. Session Complete Notification

This automation notifies you when charging is complete:

1. Download the YAML from [303_EV_Charging_Completed.yaml](https://github.com/ABovsh/eveus/blob/main/Notifications/303_EV_Charging_Completed%20(1).yaml)
2. Create a new empty automation as described above
3. Edit in YAML mode and paste the content from the downloaded file
4. Replace the notification service with your preferred notification method
5. Click "Save"

> **Tip**: If you're using Telegram, set your notification service to `notify.telegram` or your specific Telegram notification service name in each automation.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check all helper entities are properly configured
2. Monitor the connection_quality sensor for network issues
3. Verify network connectivity to the charger
4. Check the logs for detailed error messages
5. Restart the integration if needed

### Advanced Debugging

If you're experiencing issues with the SOC calculations or other sensors, follow these debugging steps:

#### 1. Enable Enhanced Logging

Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.eveus.ev_sensors: debug
    custom_components.eveus.utils: debug
    custom_components.eveus.sensor: debug
    custom_components.eveus: warning
```

Restart Home Assistant and check the logs for detailed information about sensor calculations.

#### 2. Use the Diagnostic Template

Copy and paste this template into Developer Tools > Template to get a comprehensive diagnostic report:

```yaml
{# Debug template for Eveus SOC Sensors #}
{% set debug_data = {
    'inputs': {
        'initial_soc': states('input_number.ev_initial_soc'),
        'battery_capacity': states('input_number.ev_battery_capacity'),
        'soc_correction': states('input_number.ev_soc_correction'),
        'target_soc': states('input_number.ev_target_soc')
    },
    'sensors': {
        'iem1': states('sensor.eveus_ev_charger_counter_a_energy'),
        'soc_energy': states('sensor.eveus_ev_charger_soc_energy'),
        'soc_percent': states('sensor.eveus_ev_charger_soc_percent'),
        'time_to_target': states('sensor.eveus_ev_charger_time_to_target_soc'),
        'power': states('sensor.eveus_ev_charger_power')
    }
} %}

{# Calculation Preparation #}
{% set initial_soc       = debug_data.inputs.initial_soc|float(0) %}
{% set battery_capacity  = debug_data.inputs.battery_capacity|float(0) %}
{% set soc_correction    = debug_data.inputs.soc_correction|float(0) %}
{% set energy_charged    = debug_data.sensors.iem1|float(0) %}

{# Validity Check #}
{% set input_valid = (
    initial_soc != 0 and
    battery_capacity != 0 and
    energy_charged != 'unknown' and
    energy_charged != 'unavailable'
) %}

{# Calculations #}
{% if input_valid %}
  {% set initial_kwh = (initial_soc / 100) * battery_capacity %}
  {% set efficiency  = (1 - soc_correction / 100) %}
  {% set charged_kwh = energy_charged * efficiency %}
  {% set total_kwh   = initial_kwh + charged_kwh %}

  {% set soc_energy  = total_kwh|round(2) %}
  {% set soc_percent = ((total_kwh / battery_capacity) * 100)|round(0) %}
{% else %}
  {% set soc_energy  = 'Cannot calculate - missing inputs' %}
  {% set soc_percent = 'Cannot calculate - missing inputs' %}
{% endif %}

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Possible Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| SOC sensors show "unknown" | Verify all required helper entities are created with exact names |
| "Missing input entity" error | Check that all input_number entities exist and have valid values |
| SOC calculations don't update immediately | This issue has been fixed - SOC updates happen instantly when you change input values |
| Automation errors | Update entity names in automations to match integration's naming pattern (eveus_ev_charger_*) |
| Connection failures | Verify network connectivity, check IP address, username, and password |
| Incorrect SOC calculations | Set initial SOC to match your EV's current charge level |
| Wrong time display | Integration now handles timezone correctly including DST; restart HA if issues persist |

### Reset Procedure

If you encounter persistent issues:
1. Remove the integration
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Delete any remaining eveus entities (if any)
4. Add the integration again
5. Recreate any missing input_number entities
